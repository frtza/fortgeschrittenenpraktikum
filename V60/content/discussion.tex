Overall, the results are in good agreement with theoretical predictions. The transition from LED to LASER operation
produces clearly different light patterns. The only notable caveat for this part of the procedure is that the patch does not
abruptly change from diffuse to granular appearance. Instead, there exists a narrow current interval of about
\qty{1}{\milli\ampere} in which the pattern type is not easily distinguishable. This should however not pose any problems
down the line, as the resonant current for rubidium is significantly higher than the threshold. After tuning the rubidium
fluorescence and correcting for the scanning slope, the final spectrum in Figure \ref{fig:spectrum} qualitatively matches
the expectation presented in Figure \ref{fig:Rb}, though a slight positive slope is now visible. This points to a small
overcorrection but does not detract from the interpretability of the concluding result.
