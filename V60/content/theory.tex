\label{sec:Historical Background}

Before semiconductor lasers were invented, physicists used tunable 'dye' lasers.
This worked by the use of a chemical dye as the active medium, i.e the material which produces the laser emission.
A fixed-frequency 'pump'-laser is used to create a population inversion. Each individual dye will lase over a limited wavelenght range.
This means with different dyes it is possible to generate a tunable lasers at basically all near-infrared wavelenghts.
Dye Lasers have some disadvantages. They are very large , very expensive to purchase and expensive to operate.
