\section{Setup}
\label{sec:setup}

The set-up consists of a laser diode which has both a controllable temperature and an adjustable current.
The position of the external resonator is set via a piezo stack.
Around the diode is a plexiglass cover which protects the diode from air currents and unwanted contact of the knobs.
