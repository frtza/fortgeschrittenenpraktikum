The experimental value for the Debye temperature is $\vartheta_{D, \text{exp}} = \qty{299.27+-0.19}{\kelvin}$.
The following results for the theoretical Debye temperature $ \vartheta_{D, \text{theo}} = \qty{332.208}{\kelvin}$.
It follows a relative deviation of the experimental value of $\num{9.91}\%$.
The deviation is within the acceptable range, as systematic errors may have occurred during the experiment.
First, heat convection never completely ruled out, which could have influenced the measurement.
