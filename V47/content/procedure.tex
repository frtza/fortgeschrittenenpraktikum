\section{Procedure}
\label{sec:procedure}

Initially, the sample needs to be cooled down. First, we evacuate the recipient and replace the air with
helium gas. Due to its low boiling point of \qty{4}{\kelvin} the new medium remains gaseous even
at temperatures around \qty{77}{\kelvin} where air might liquify and any water contents would freeze.
This allows us to achieve lower pressures by again removing all gases from the recipient after the
lowest temperature is reached in order to prevent heat losses via conduction, convection, evaporation
or radiation. Now we proceed with taking actual measurements. To this end, sample and cylinder
are supplied with heat energy via electrical power, minimizing the temperature gradient and thereby increasing
accuracy. We record intervals of temperature $\Delta T$ and time $\Delta t$ as well as voltage
$U$ and current $I$ to determine $\Delta Q = UI \Delta t$ and from this the isobaric heat capacity.
Finally, we convert to the isochoric case and discuss some important observations.
