\section[Theory]{Theory \textnormal{\cite{GrossMarx+2022}}}
\label{sec:theory}

In the description of condensed matter, tools from classical thermodynamics and statistical physics as well
as quantum mechanical considerations need to be applied. Throughout the following paragraphs, we explore some
of the more well known models in the subfield of thermal properties, specifically for the explanation of the
heat capacity in solids.
